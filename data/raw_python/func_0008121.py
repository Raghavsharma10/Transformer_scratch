def sample(self, nsamples, nburn=0, nthin=1, save_hidden_state_trajectory=False,
               call_back=None):
        """Sample from the BHMM posterior.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nsamples : int
            The number of samples to generate.
        nburn : int, optional, default=0
            The number of samples to discard to burn-in, following which `nsamples` will be generated.
        nthin : int, optional, default=1
            The number of Gibbs sampling updates used to generate each returned sample.
        save_hidden_state_trajectory : bool, optional, default=False
            If True, the hidden state trajectory for each sample will be saved as well.
        call_back : function, optional, default=None
            a call back function with no arguments, which if given is being called
            after each computed sample. This is useful for implementing progress bars.

        Returns
        -------
        models : list of bhmm.HMM
            The sampled HMM models from the Bayesian posterior.

        Examples
        --------

        >>> from bhmm import testsystems
        >>> [model, observations, states, sampled_model] = testsystems.generate_random_bhmm(ntrajectories=5, length=1000)
        >>> nburn = 5 # run the sampler a bit before recording samples
        >>> nsamples = 10 # generate 10 samples
        >>> nthin = 2 # discard one sample in between each recorded sample
        >>> samples = sampled_model.sample(nsamples, nburn=nburn, nthin=nthin)
