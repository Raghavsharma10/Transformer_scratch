        Connect receiver to sender for signal.

        Arguments:

            receiver
                A function or an instance method which is to receive signals.
                Receivers must be hashable objects.

                If weak is True, then receiver must be weak referenceable.

                Receivers must be able to accept keyword arguments.

                If a receiver is connected with a dispatch_uid argument, it
                will not be added if another receiver was already connected
                with that dispatch_uid.

            sender
                The sender to which the receiver should respond. Must either be
                of type Signal, or None to receive events from any sender.

            weak
                Whether to use weak references to the receiver. By default, the
                module will attempt to use weak references to the receiver
                objects. If this parameter is false, then strong references will
                be used.

            dispatch_uid
                An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular instance of
                a receiver. This will usually be a string, though it may be
                anything hashable.
