        The add_toggle_actions() method is a convenience method that creates a
        number of gtk.ToggleAction objects based on the information in the list
        of action entry tuples contained in entries and adds them to the action
        group. The toggle action entry tuples can vary in size from one to seven
        items with the following information:

            * The name of the action. Must be specified.
            * The stock id for the action. Optional with a default value of None
              if a label is specified.
            * The label for the action. This field should typically be marked
              for translation, see the set_translation_domain() method. Optional
              with a default value of None if a stock id is specified.
            * The accelerator for the action, in the format understood by the
              gtk.accelerator_parse() function. Optional with a default value of
              None.
            * The tooltip for the action. This field should typically be marked
              for translation, see the set_translation_domain() method. Optional
              with a default value of None.
            * The callback function invoked when the action is activated.
              Optional with a default value of None.
            * A flag indicating whether the toggle action is active. Optional
              with a default value of False.

        The "activate" signals of the actions are connected to the callbacks and
        their accel paths are set to <Actions>/group-name/action-name.
