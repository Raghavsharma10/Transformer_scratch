        r""" Write the given lines of text to this file.

        By default this overwrites any existing file at this path.

        This puts a platform-specific newline sequence on every line.
        See `linesep` below.

            `lines` - A list of strings.

            `encoding` - A Unicode encoding to use.  This applies only if
                `lines` contains any Unicode strings.

            `errors` - How to handle errors in Unicode encoding.  This
                also applies only to Unicode strings.

            linesep - The desired line-ending.  This line-ending is
                applied to every line.  If a line already has any
                standard line ending (``'\r'``, ``'\n'``, ``'\r\n'``,
                ``u'\x85'``, ``u'\r\x85'``, ``u'\u2028'``), that will
                be stripped off and this will be used instead.  The
                default is os.linesep, which is platform-dependent
                (``'\r\n'`` on Windows, ``'\n'`` on Unix, etc.).
                Specify ``None`` to write the lines as-is, like
                :meth:`file.writelines`.

        Use the keyword argument ``append=True`` to append lines to the
        file.  The default is to overwrite the file.

        .. warning ::

            When you use this with Unicode data, if the encoding of the
            existing data in the file is different from the encoding
            you specify with the `encoding=` parameter, the result is
            mixed-encoding data, which can really confuse someone trying
            to read the file later.
