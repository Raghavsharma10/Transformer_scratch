        Args:
            linear (list/dict): Linear terms of the model (h).
            quadratic (dict of (int, int):float): Quadratic terms of the model (J).

            configuration file, which is configured to access a D-Wave 2000Q QPU, submits a
            simple :term:`Ising` problem (opposite linear biases on two coupled qubits), and samples
            5 times.
