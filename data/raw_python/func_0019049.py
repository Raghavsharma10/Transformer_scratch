def calc_am_um_v1(self):
    """Calculate the flown through area and the wetted perimeter
    of the main channel.

    Note that the main channel is assumed to have identical slopes on
    both sides and that water flowing exactly above the main channel is
    contributing to |AM|.  Both theoretical surfaces seperating water
    above the main channel from water above both forelands are
    contributing to |UM|.

    Required control parameters:
      |HM|
      |BM|
      |BNM|

    Required flux sequence:
      |H|

    Calculated flux sequence:
      |AM|
      |UM|

    Examples:

        Generally, a trapezoid with reflection symmetry is assumed.  Here its
        smaller base (bottom) has a length of 2 meters, its legs show an
        inclination of 1 meter per 4 meters, and its height (depths) is 1
        meter:

        >>> from hydpy.models.lstream import *
        >>> parameterstep()
        >>> bm(2.0)
        >>> bnm(4.0)
        >>> hm(1.0)

        The first example deals with normal flow conditions, where water
        flows within the main channel completely (|H| < |HM|):

        >>> fluxes.h = 0.5
        >>> model.calc_am_um_v1()
        >>> fluxes.am
        am(2.0)
        >>> fluxes.um
        um(6.123106)

        The second example deals with high flow conditions, where water
        flows over the foreland also (|H| > |HM|):

        >>> fluxes.h = 1.5
        >>> model.calc_am_um_v1()
        >>> fluxes.am
        am(11.0)
        >>> fluxes.um
        um(11.246211)

        The third example checks the special case of a main channel with zero
        height:

        >>> hm(0.0)
        >>> model.calc_am_um_v1()
        >>> fluxes.am
        am(3.0)
        >>> fluxes.um
        um(5.0)

        The fourth example checks the special case of the actual water stage
        not being larger than zero (empty channel):

        >>> fluxes.h = 0.0
        >>> hm(1.0)
        >>> model.calc_am_um_v1()
        >>> fluxes.am
        am(0.0)
        >>> fluxes.um
        um(0.0)
