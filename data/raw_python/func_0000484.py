        Given access to the configuration dict that galaxy passed us, we try and connect to galaxy's API.
        First we try connecting to galaxy directly, using an IP address given
        us by docker (since the galaxy host is the default gateway for docker).
        Using additional information collected by galaxy like the port it is
        running on and the application path, we build a galaxy URL and test our
        connection by attempting to get a history listing. This is done to
        avoid any nasty network configuration that a SysAdmin has placed
        between galaxy and us inside docker, like disabling API queries.
        If that fails, we failover to using the URL the user is accessing
        through. This will succeed where the previous connection fails under
        the conditions of REMOTE_USER and galaxy running under uWSGI.
