def asDirect(self):
        """Returns the image data as a direct representation of an
        ``x * y * planes`` array.  This method is intended to remove the
        need for callers to deal with palettes and transparency
        themselves.  Images with a palette (colour type 3)
        are converted to RGB or RGBA; images with transparency (a
        ``tRNS`` chunk) are converted to LA or RGBA as appropriate.
        When returned in this format the pixel values represent the
        colour value directly without needing to refer to palettes or
        transparency information.

        Like the :meth:`read` method this method returns a 4-tuple:

        (*width*, *height*, *pixels*, *meta*)

        This method normally returns pixel values with the bit depth
        they have in the source image, but when the source PNG has an
        ``sBIT`` chunk it is inspected and can reduce the bit depth of
        the result pixels; pixel values will be reduced according to
        the bit depth specified in the ``sBIT`` chunk (PNG nerds should
        note a single result bit depth is used for all channels; the
        maximum of the ones specified in the ``sBIT`` chunk.  An RGB565
        image will be rescaled to 6-bit RGB666).

        The *meta* dictionary that is returned reflects the `direct`
        format and not the original source image.  For example, an RGB
        source image with a ``tRNS`` chunk to represent a transparent
        colour, will have ``planes=3`` and ``alpha=False`` for the
        source image, but the *meta* dictionary returned by this method
        will have ``planes=4`` and ``alpha=True`` because an alpha
        channel is synthesized and added.

        *pixels* is the pixel data in boxed row flat pixel format (just
        like the :meth:`read` method).

        All the other aspects of the image data are not changed.
