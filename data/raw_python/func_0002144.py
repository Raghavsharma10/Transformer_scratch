def get_wind_components(speed, wdir):
    r"""Calculate the U, V wind vector components from the speed and direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    speed : array_like
        The wind speed (magnitude)
    wdir : array_like
        The wind direction, specified as the direction from which the wind is
        blowing, with 0 being North.

    Returns
    -------
    u, v : tuple of array_like
        The wind components in the X (East-West) and Y (North-South)
        directions, respectively.

    """
    u = -speed * np.sin(wdir)
    v = -speed * np.cos(wdir)
    return u, v
