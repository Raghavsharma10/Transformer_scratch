        Initialize with a uniform distribution between two values.

        If no ``weight_interval`` is passed, this weight distribution
        will just consist of ``[(lowest, 1), (highest, 1)]``. If specified,
        weights (still with uniform weight distribution) will be added every
        ``weight_interval``. Use this if you intend to modify the weights
        in any complex way after initialization.
