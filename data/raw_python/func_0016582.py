def check_problem(self, linear, quadratic):
        """Test if an Ising model matches the graph provided by the solver.

        Args:
            linear (list/dict): Linear terms of the model (h).
            quadratic (dict of (int, int):float): Quadratic terms of the model (J).

            boolean

        Examples:
            This example creates a client using the local system's default D-Wave Cloud Client
            configuration file, which is configured to access a D-Wave 2000Q QPU, and
            tests a simple :term:`Ising` model for two target embeddings (that is, representations
            of the model's graph by coupled qubits on the QPU's sparsely connected graph),
            where only the second is valid.
